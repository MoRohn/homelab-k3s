# GPU scheduling and resource protection

## Authority

`gpusched`, a host systemd user unit on `127.0.0.1:8770` and `10.42.0.1:8770` running in enforce mode, is the **only** GPU admission authority on this host. LIF is a read-only client.

- LIF reads `GET /metrics` with the gpusched **`metrics`** token (Secret `lif-gpusched`). That token can do nothing else.
- LIF pods never set `runtimeClassName: nvidia` or `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. Any CUDA context of 256 MiB or more without a lease would raise gpusched's `unmanaged` hold, blocking the primary workload's own admissions.
- A `lif:` token line exists in `~/.config/bnn/gpusched.token`, but it is **dormant** until gpusched restarts, because it reads tokens only at startup.

Kubernetes PriorityClasses order CPU and RAM inside K3s only. The kubelet can't see unified GPU memory.

## Primary-workload capacity state (`lif/gpu/state.py`)

The state is polled every 5 s and treated as stale after 30 s.

| State | Condition |
|---|---|
| IMMINENT | a `gpusched_leases{klass="production"}` is live, OR a resident isn't loaded (reloading), OR gpusched is unreachable or stale (**fail-safe**) |
| HIGH | `gpusched_forecast_p_arrival_next_hour` ≥ 0.50 |
| MODERATE | P ≥ 0.20, or no forecast |
| LOW | otherwise |

The forecast is gpusched's own: validated, recency-weighted, with a backtest Brier score of 0.069. It rises ahead of the Stream It windows (ET 01:45–07:00, 07:45–10:30, 12:45–14:30, 17:45–19:30).

## CAN_RUN (`can_run(job, snapshot)`, deterministic)

| Job | LOW/MODERATE | HIGH | IMMINENT |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0–P1 (primary workload) | RUN | RUN | RUN |
| P2–P3 CPU (interactive) | RUN | RUN | RUN_DEGRADED |
| P4 CPU (async) | RUN | RUN | QUEUE (or RUN_DEGRADED if it can't wait) |
| P5 CPU (batch) | RUN | RUN | PAUSE_BACKGROUND |
| P6–P8 CPU (eval/experiments) | RUN | QUEUE | PAUSE_BACKGROUND |
| any GPU job | QUEUE: must go through a gpusched lease; REJECT if it can't wait and memory > admissible | | |

The P0–P8 levels map to gpusched classes as P0–1 → production, P2–3 → interactive, and P4–8 → background.

## CPU tiers: why, and their cost

- Today gpusched admits about **0.6–1.2 GiB**, so no LLM fits on the GPU.
- The CPU tiers run llama.cpp on the **A725 cores only** (`--cpu-mask 7C1F`, CPUs 0–4 and 10–14), with `--no-repack`, a q8_0 KV cache, and a hard cgroup memory limit.
- They create no CUDA context, so a GPU takeover can't evict them.

### The `--no-repack` lesson (measured 2026-09-30)

- By default, llama.cpp repacks quantized weights into **anonymous** memory.
- The 4B model held 3.1 GB anonymous. Three models dropped MemAvailable from ~10 to 3.9 GiB, PSI reached 4.2, swap grew, and gpusched admissible went to 0.
- With `--no-repack` the weights stay file-backed (reclaimable). 4B anon dropped to **~670 MiB**, at a cost of only **−5 % decode** (22.3 → 21.1 tok/s).
- Measured anon today: 4B ~670–850 MiB, 1.7B ~530–680 MiB, and embedding ~296 MiB after cutting its context to 4096 tokens over 2 slots.
- Vision models (CPU tier, `--mmproj`) also hold the image projector in **anonymous** memory, because llama.cpp reads it into buffers and doesn't mmap it. Sizing adds the projector plus 512 MiB of image-encoder headroom to total and anon. The 512 MiB is an **estimate, not yet measured**. The text-side anon budget (1,536 MiB) is unchanged, and the projector plus headroom gets its own 2,048 MiB cap. Estimated by `hardware_fit`, not measured (Qwen3-VL-4B Q4_K_M + Q8_0 projector, 8192 ctx): ~1.7 GiB anon and ~4.0 GiB total.

### Bandwidth yield

GB10's CPU and GPU share one memory bus. With the CPU tiers saturated (8 concurrent generations), production LLM decode went from **2.98 / 3.09 tok/s idle to 2.74 tok/s, about −10 %**. That is n = 1 per arm, so it is indicative only (`benchmarks/2026-10-01-production-llm-interference.md`, private, local only).

While the primary workload is IMMINENT, the gateway therefore:
- drops CPU concurrency to `yield.cpu_concurrency_blerbz` (1);
- caps `max_tokens` at 512.

Batch P5 and above pauses.

Also measured: 4-way concurrency on the 4B model *lowers* aggregate throughput (21 → 16.4 tok/s), so its concurrency is set to 2.

## Host memory guard (controller, every 5 s)

LIF hands memory back **before** gpusched's 8 GiB headroom is crossed, whatever the cause.

| Group | Deployments | Shed below | Restore above |
|---|---|---|---|
| optional | `tier0-small` | 9216 MiB MemAvailable | 10240 MiB |
| secondary | `embedding` | 6144 MiB | 8704 MiB |
| hot fallback | `tier0` | never shed by the guard | — |

- Each condition must hold for 60 s, which avoids flapping.
- Shed state is persisted, so it survives a controller restart.
- There is no action without a trustworthy gpusched reading.
- **Observed 2026-10-01 07:21:** Firefox and interactive desktop sessions (~2 GiB) pushed MemAvailable to ~7.9 GiB. The guard shed `tier0-small`, and `local/instant` was served by the 4B with `fallback: true`.
- Even with that done, MemAvailable stayed below 8 GiB because of non-LIF processes. LIF alone cannot restore the headroom.

## Why there are no GPU tiers yet, and the concrete path

1. **GRAMZ unload only happens for `kind: command` jobs.**
   - In gpusched, `_maybe_unload_for` requires `spec.kind == "command"` and `preemptible`.
   - K8s-gated pods (the gate and hold sidecars) can **never** trigger the ~34.6 GB unload.
   - A GPU tier therefore needs a gpusched **command-job adapter**: a preemptible command (e.g. `docker run` or a scheduler-owned unit) that serves a llama.cpp-cuda or vLLM model, attributed by container, and is stopped on preemption.
   - That keeps gpusched as the authority. Unloads happen only at P(production) ≤ 10 %, the reload takes ~165 s, and the window shuts at reserved windows.
   - The hardware-fit verdict `fits_when_gramz_unloaded` marks models suitable for this path.
2. **Proposal (owner decision): requantize the production LLM.**
   - Serving Qwen2.5-32B as FP8 instead of bf16 frees about 30 GB.
   - It would likely also improve the ~3 tok/s decode behind Stream It's 39 % pre-fix failure rate.
   - It must keep the `:8100` contract (including the `adapter` field) and pass a primary-workload quality evaluation before cutover.
3. Any vLLM start needs an explicit memory size and a lease `mem_mb` that covers the load peak. Never use the default `gpu_memory_utilization`.

**Status: not implemented or validated.** A live primary-workload GPU takeover of a LIF GPU model has not been tested, because no LIF GPU model exists.
